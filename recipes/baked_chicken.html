        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken schnitzel is a breeze to make in the oven. Plus, this method uses less oil 
            and has easier cleanup. The breaded chicken breasts are baked until golden and crispy 
            on the outside, yet they're still tender and juicy on the inside. Serve schnitzels 
            with lemon wedges and a German-style potato salad.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as desired</li>
            <li>6 chicken breasts, cut in half lengthwise (butterflied)</li>
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Â¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground paprika</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>2 cups seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 large lemon, zested</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Prepare</li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large 
                baking sheet with aluminum foil and drizzle olive oil over foil. 
                Place the baking sheet in the oven as it preheats.</p>
            
            <p>Meanwhile, place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap 
                on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound with the smooth side of a 
                meat mallet to 1/4-inch thickness. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</p>
            
            <li>Mix</li>
            <p>Mix flour and paprika together in a shallow bowl. Whisk eggs, salt, 
                and pepper together in a second shallow bowl. Mix bread crumbs and 
                lemon zest together in a third shallow bowl. </p>

            <p></p>
            
            <li>Coat</li>
            <p>Dredge one piece of chicken in flour; shake off excess. Dip into 
                beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press 
                into bread crumbs to coat both sides. Place the breaded chicken, 
                unstacked, onto a plate. Repeat with remaining chicken.</p>

            <p>Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Arrange chicken in a single 
                layer on the hot sheet. Drizzle more olive oil over each piece.</p>

            <li>Serve</li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes. Flip chicken and continue 
                baking until no longer pink in the center and the breading is lightly 
                browned, 5 to 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into 
                the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
